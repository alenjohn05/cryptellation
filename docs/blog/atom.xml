        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello there! Welcome on the first post of the Cryptellation blog!</p><p>It's been quite a long since I started this project and there was no documentation
to explain what is Cryptellation and how to use it. Well, for my own sake of
keeping in mind everything and also for everyone that could be interested in this
project, I started this documentation hoping that it can help anyone interested
in this system.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-cryptellation">What is Cryptellation?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-is-cryptellation" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Cryptellation is a cryptocurrency investment system that let you test different
strategies by doing backtests, forward tests and live running.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-the-motive-behind-it">What is the motive behind it?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-is-the-motive-behind-it" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Many would think that this system is a bit overkill for the first need, and they
would be right! As a cloud developer, I wanted to develop my own system to understand
it as much as possible and make it as automatable as possible, running it on a
Kubernetes cluster being a must have for making several strategies training at the
same time. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-to-use-it">How to use it?<a class="hash-link" href="#how-to-use-it" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>At the time I'm writing these lines, the Helm chart is not even created and the
<a href="/docs/category/getting-started">documentation on how to get started</a> is empty
as hell. I'll add the necessary files as soon as I can.</p><p>However, do not hesitate to follow the
<a href="https://github.com/digital-feather/cryptellation#readme" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">README.md</a> to have a
first look on the system.</p>]]></content>
