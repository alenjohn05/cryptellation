Welcome on the first post of the Cryptellation blog!\\n\\nIt\'s been quite a long since I started this project and there was no documentation\\nto explain what is Cryptellation and how to use it. Well, for my own sake of \\nkeeping in mind everything and also for everyone that could be interested in this\\nproject, I started this documentation hoping that it can help anyone interested \\nin this system.\\n\\n## What is Cryptellation?\\n\\nCryptellation is a cryptocurrency investment system that let you test different\\nstrategies by doing backtests, forward tests and live running.\\n\\n## What is the motive behind it?\\n\\nMany would think that this system is a bit overkill for the first need, and they\\nwould be right! As a cloud developer, I wanted to develop my own system to understand\\nit as much as possible and make it as automatable as possible, running it on a \\nKubernetes cluster being a must have for making several strategies training at the\\nsame time. \\n\\n## How to use it?\\n\\nAt the time I\'m writing these lines, the Helm chart is not even created and the \\n[documentation on how to get started](/docs/category/getting-started) is empty\\nas hell. I\'ll add the necessary files as soon as I can.\\n\\nHowever, do not hesitate to follow the \\n[README.md](https://github.com/digital-feather/cryptellation#readme) to have a \\nfirst look on the system."}]}')}}]);
